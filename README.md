## Code for the paper of "A Lightweight Model for Physiological Signals based Sleep Staging with Multi-Class CAM for Model Explainability" 
This is the initial version of the model proposed in the paper "A Lightweight Model for Physiological Signals based Sleep Staging with Multi-Class CAM for Model Explainability" which is still in the peer-review stage.  
In this paper, we propose a lightweight model for automatic sleep stage.The inputs of the model are 30s EEG and EOG signals.
