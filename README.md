## Code for the paper "A Lightweight Model for Physiological Signals based Sleep Staging with Multi-Class CAM for Model Explainability" 
This is the initial version of the model proposed in the paper "A Lightweight Model for Physiological Signals based Sleep Staging with Multi-Class CAM for Model Explainability". The paper is still in the peer-review stage.  
In this paper, we propose a lightweight model for the automatic sleep stage. The inputs of the model are 30s EEG and EOG signals.
